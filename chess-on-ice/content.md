[UTACM 2/23/18 Problem 2] (https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/acm-22318/challenges/chess-on-ice)

**Problem Statement**

Sometimes referred to "chess on ice", curling is a sport of strategy. In each "end", only the team with the stones closer to the center of the circle scores points. The team with the highest total score (sum of scores in each end) after 10 ends wins the match.

For each end, you are told which team scored and how many points they scored. Determine which team wins the match.

**Input Format**

The first two lines each contain a single string, the two countries competing in the match. The next 10 lines contain a string *S* and an integer *N*, where *S* denotes which country scored in that end and *N* denotes how many points were scored.

**Constraints**

1 <= *N* <= 8

**Output Format**

Output the country that wins the match. In the case of a tie, print 'Tie'.
